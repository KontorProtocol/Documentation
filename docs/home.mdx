<div className="page-intro">
  Kontor is a next-generation Bitcoin metaprotocol that brings programmable assets and scalable file storage directly to the Bitcoin blockchain. Build rich smart contracts and store data perpetually—all secured by Bitcoin's hashpower, with no validators, bridges, sequencers or sidechains.

## Kontor Protocol

Kontor extends Bitcoin's functionality by building directly on top of it. Each Kontor transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, fully secured by Bitcoin's hashpower, with all logic executed on-chain. We're bringing new functionality to Bitcoin without trying to turn it into something it isn't.

## Sigil Smart Contracts  

Write, deploy and run rich smart contract applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Sigil framework uses the WebAssembly Component Model to make writing contracts easier than ever before, with strong type safety, rich types, native cross-contract calls and best-in-class developer ergonomics. Writing contracts with Sigil feels just like writing normal software.

## Perpetual File Storage

A "pay-once, store-forever" model for file storage secured by Bitcoin's hashpower, offering the highest levels of data persistence without bloating the underlying blockchain. For developers who want an alternative to embedding file data directly in transactions, Kontor offers a novel solution that truly complements Bitcoin's built-in functionality and scales to meet user demand.

## Economic Model

The Kontor economic model was designed from first principles to support data storage and smart contract execution. Keeping BTC as its primary unit of account, Kontor smart contract execution burns KOR, which Bitcoin users can purchase trustlessly in single-confirmation atomic swaps. KOR emissions incentivize perpetual data storage and scale dynamically to keep inflation within bounds.

**Current Status:** Kontor is under active development with Bitcoin signet and testnet support. The Indexer codebase is fully open-source and available on GitHub.
