# Sigil

Sigi is an embedded domain specific language for Bitcoin Smart Contracts. It provides a streamlined approach to building contracts on the Kontor metaprotocol, leveraging WebAssemblyâ€™s Component Model. Its minimal runtime primitives and userspace abstractions enable secure, gas-efficient contracts with a familiar development experience. Storage is isolated, cross-contract calls are convenient to perform while re-entrances are strictly prohibited, `fallback` hook enables support for contract versioning via proxying.

The zip provided to you includes five example contracts demonstrating contract patterns from basic queries to dynamic proxying. Each example includes Rust code, WIT interfaces, and tests. Run `cargo test` in the `test/` directory (e.g., `sigil-example-contracts/hello-world/test`) to simulate blockchain execution and iterate quickly.

## Get Started

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to set up your environment and explore `sigil-example-contracts`. Future test tooling will include live Kontor instances and client-side SDK integration with Bitcoin testnet for full blockchain validation.
