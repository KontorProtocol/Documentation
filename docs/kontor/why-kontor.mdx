Kontor brings DeFi directly to Bitcoin without moving transactions off-chain or changing the value proposition of BTC.

**Build where the value is.** Bitcoin is the deepest, most liquid, and most trusted blockchain network in the world. By building on Kontor, you're tapping directly into Bitcoin's ecosystem—its users, its capital, its security guarantees—without the friction of bridges, wrapped tokens, or convincing people to move to yet another chain. Your applications settle on Bitcoin itself, with the same finality guarantees as BTC transactions. There's no separate network to bootstrap, no additional consensus to trust, and no parasitic relationship with the underlying chain.

**Developer experience.** Kontor's Sigil framework is built on WebAssembly and designed to feel like writing normal software. If you know Rust, you can start building immediately—no learning obscure DSLs or fighting with baroque tooling. Sigil offers strong compile-time type safety, native cross-contract calls, and an expressive storage interface that handles nested data structures naturally. The SDK gets you from idea to working demo in minutes, not weeks. Contract interactions are explicitly typed and caught at compile time rather than failing at runtime.

**True interoperability.** Kontor offers single-confirmation atomic swaps with Bitcoin and all major Bitcoin metaprotocols—Ordinals, Runes, Counterparty. You can chain a BTC-to-KOR swap directly with a contract call, meaning any Bitcoin user can interact with your application immediately without leaving their wallet or pre-funding a separate account. The hybrid UTXO model treats assets as first-class citizens: they attach to UTXOs for PSBT-based trading and detach for programmable logic. This level of interoperability isn't possible on sidechains or rollups; it requires being genuinely on-chain.

**Aligned with Bitcoin.** Unlike Layer-2s that siphon fees and activity away from Bitcoin, Kontor is synergistic: every Kontor transaction pays Bitcoin miners, every storage agreement increases on-chain activity, and the protocol operates to expand BTC's utility without competing for its monetary premium. KOR is a metered resource for execution and storage, complementary by design. Miners are incentivized to support Kontor because it makes their blocks more valuable without threatening Bitcoin's core value proposition.
