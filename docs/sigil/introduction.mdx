**Sigil** is a **next-generation WebAssembly-based smart contract framework** that enables developers to develop, deploy, and run rich smart contract applications on Bitcoin with the Kontor metaprotocol. Sigil is designed to offer strong compile-time type safety, powerful language built-ins, an expressive storage interface, rich native types, native cross-contract calls and excellent overall ergonomics.

**Attention:** Sigil is currently in *early-preview* and available to select developers for feedback and review. Developers can write smart contracts with Sigil, but not yet execute them with the Kontor Indexer or deploy them to a Bitcoin network.

Planned features include:

- Support for list types in storage
- Native `Address` type
- Gas tracking
- Events system
- Typescript SDK for interacting with contracts clientside
- Integration with the Kontor Indexer 
- Enhanced querying capabilities, including key prefix matching for `Map` types

## Why Sigil?

The primary goal of the Sigil framework is to make writing safe, secure smart contracts easy and natural. Unlike other smart contract frameworks, writing contracts in Sigil is designed to feel like writing normal software, requiring developers to learn a minimum number of additional concepts and to jump through as few hoops as possible to write, deploy and run their contracts on Bitcoin with Kontor.

Sigil notably leverages the WebAssembly Component Model to allow contracts to link natively and with full type-safety. This provides deep integration with conventional IDEs and popular Rust tooling. It shifts errors to build-time, keeps determinism and gas behavior predictable, and reduces the trusted computing base. Sigil thus dramatically improves developer ergonomics while fully supporting a flexible and extensible ecosystem built on open standards.
