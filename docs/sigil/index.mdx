# Sigil Smart Contract Framework

Sigil is a next-generation Rust DSL for smart contracts that run on the Kontor Bitcoin metaprotocol. Sigil leverages the WebAssembly Component Model to make the experience of writing smart contracts _as close as possible to that of writing regular software_, while still offering all of the safety and determinism guarantees necessary for building secure and robust decentralized applications.

These docs are distributed with a ZIP file that includes five example contracts demonstrating contract patterns from basic queries to dynamic contract-module proxying. Each example includes Rust code, WIT interfaces, and tests. Run `cargo test` in the `test/` directory (e.g., `sigil-example-contracts/hello-world/test`) to simulate blockchain execution.
