title: What is Kontor?
---

Kontor is a Bitcoin metaprotocol that brings programmable assets and verifiable long-term file storage directly to Bitcoin. Unlike sidechains or rollups that create separate networks, Kontor operates entirely on Bitcoin itself—every Kontor transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, secured by Bitcoin's full hashpower and finality guarantees. This means you can build and deploy sophisticated applications on Bitcoin without leaving the Bitcoin network or trusting additional consensus mechanisms.

At its core, Kontor addresses what blockchains are actually used for: creating, managing, and transferring digital assets. It provides two key capabilities that Bitcoin alone cannot offer. First, **Sigil**, a next-generation WebAssembly-based smart contract framework that lets developers write expressive, type-safe contracts in familiar languages like Rust. Second, a **file persistence protocol** that stores data off-chain with cryptographic proofs and economic incentives anchored on Bitcoin, solving the problem of expensive on-chain storage without sacrificing persistence or availability.

Kontor introduces **KOR**, a native token designed specifically for metering smart contract execution and incentivizing perpetual file storage. KOR complements rather than competes with BTC: Bitcoin remains the settlement layer and unit of account, while KOR acts as "gas" for computation and storage rewards. This dual-token model respects BTC's role as digital gold while providing the economic infrastructure needed for a thriving application ecosystem.

Importantly, Kontor is fully interoperable with Bitcoin and other Bitcoin metaprotocols like Ordinals, Runes, and Counterparty. Through a novel hybrid UTXO model, assets can be "attached" to Bitcoin UTXOs for atomic swaps and native Bitcoin Script interactions, then "detached" for use in smart contracts—all in a single confirmation. This means any Bitcoin user can interact with Kontor immediately, using standard Bitcoin addresses and wallets, without bridging assets or managing separate accounts.

Kontor extends Bitcoin's functionality without changing its security model or value proposition. It's a practical path toward decentralized finance on Bitcoin that miners are incentivized to support, developers can build on today, and the broader Bitcoin community can embrace as genuinely Bitcoin-native infrastructure.
