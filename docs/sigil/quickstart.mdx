This guide walks you through setting up your development environment for Sigil smart contract development.

## Prerequisites

### Install Dependencies

#### MacOS
Install `binaryen` and `brotli` using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install binaryen brotli
```

#### Debian
Install `binaryen` and `brotli`:
```bash
sudo apt install binaryen brotli
```

### Set Up Rust
Sigil is built with Rust, so you need the latest stable Rust version installed.

1. Install Rust by following the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) or update to the latest stable version.
2. Add the WebAssembly target for compiling Sigil contracts:
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

## Your First Contract

Now that your environment is set up, follow the [Hello World example](/docs/sigil/examples/hello-world) to build and test your first Sigil smart contract.

The Hello World tutorial covers:
- Project structure and configuration
- Writing the WIT interface
- Implementing contract logic
- Building and optimizing WASM output
- Writing and running tests
- Common errors and solutions

## Next Steps

After completing Hello World, explore more examples:
- [**Token**](/docs/sigil/examples/token) - Learn about storage, maps, and state management
- [**Shared Account**](/docs/sigil/examples/shared-account) - See cross-contract calls in action
- [**AMM**](/docs/sigil/examples/amm) - Build a full automated market maker with complex logic
- [**Pool**](/docs/sigil/examples/pool) - Understand liquidity pool patterns

For deeper understanding, see the [Reference documentation](/docs/sigil/reference/contract-structure).
