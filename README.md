# Website

The Sigil documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

PR's merged into the `main` branch will trigger a deployment to the production site.
