# Numbers and numeric operations

## Number types and ranges

Two number types are provided to the contracts, `Integer` and `Decimal`, providing integer and fixed-point decimal arithmetic respectively.

`Decimal` supports up to 18 decimal places and can accurately represent values in the `±(2^256 - 1) / 10^18` range (`±115_792_089_237_316_195_423_570_985_008_687_907_853_269_984_665_640_564_039_457.584_007_913_129_639_936`).

`Integer` is capped to the same range with the decimal part truncated (`±115_792_089_237_316_195_423_570_985_008_687_907_853_269_984_665_640_564_039_457`).

## Arithmetic operations

Both types supports basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `sub`, `mul` and `div`) as well as comparisons. In addition to this `Decimal` supports a range of more complex operations (`log10`, TBD).

Basic operations can be performed using regular operators, so you can simply do things like `if a + b > c` with both types.

## Checked arithmetic

For checked arithmetic, use the respective methods implemented by the types, which return `Result<T, Error>` where `Error` will be `Error::Overflow` or `Error::DivByZero` if either of these conditions have occurred.

Example:
```
match a.add(b) {
    case Ok(result) => ... // use result
    case Err(err)   => ... // handle overflow error
}
```

## Advanced operations

Currently a `.sqrt()` method for for `Decimal` and a `.log10()` method for `Integer` exist. We will continue to expand the range of operations supported by these types.
