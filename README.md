# Kontor Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Kontor, a next-generation metaprotocol on Bitcoin that brings programmable assets and perpetual file storage to the world's most secure blockchain.

## Running the Documentation Site

This documentation site is built using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/).

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npx mintlify dev
```

This starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000` and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without restarting the server.

### Deployment

PRs merged into the `main` branch will trigger a deployment to the production site.

## Contributing

Contributions to the documentation are welcome! Please submit pull requests for any improvements, corrections, or additions.
