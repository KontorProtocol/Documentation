This section covers the example contracts in `example-contracts/`. Each is a self-contained example that builds on concepts introduced in previous ones, progressing from a minimal contract to production-grade DeFi applications. The examples demonstrate how to develop blockchain smart contracts with seamless Rust-like testing and rapid feedback in a local development environment.

## Suggested Learning Order

1. **hello-world** → Minimal contract structure, basic functions
2. **token** → Map-based ledger, Integer type, error handling
3. **shared-account** → Nested Maps, authorization patterns
4. **proxy** → Fallback function, delegation patterns
5. **pool** → DeFi math, liquidity pools
6. **amm** → Multi-pool AMM, production patterns

{/* Note: arith and fib examples exist in SMART_CONTRACTS_GUIDE but not yet in docs */}

## Example Contracts

### hello-world

Minimal contract demonstrating basic contract structure, view functions, and simple state management.

[View Example →](/docs/sigil/examples/hello-world)

---

### token (59 lines)

Fungible token with Map-based ledger, arbitrary precision Integer arithmetic, balance transfers, and error handling for insufficient funds.

[View Example →](/docs/sigil/examples/token)

---

### shared-account

Multi-tenant account management with two-level nested Maps, authorization patterns (owner and tenants), helper functions for access control, and contract receiving tokens via `contract_signer()`.

[View Example →](/docs/sigil/examples/shared-account)

---

### proxy

Generic contract delegation using the fallback function, FallContext, and `foreign::call` for dynamic forwarding. Demonstrates proxy/upgrade patterns.

[View Example →](/docs/sigil/examples/proxy)

---

### pool (200+ lines)

Single liquidity pool implementation with constant product AMM math, LP token management, swap calculations, and slippage protection using Integer arithmetic.

[View Example →](/docs/sigil/examples/pool)

---

### amm (350+ lines)

Multi-pool automated market maker managing multiple token pairs with Map of Pool structs, dynamic token handling, pool creation, and production-grade validation logic.

## Example Contract Sizes

After optimization and Brotli compression:

| Contract | Compressed Size |
|----------|----------------|
| hello-world | ~2 KB |
| token | ~3 KB |
| proxy | ~3 KB |
| shared-account | ~6 KB |
| pool | ~10 KB |
| amm | ~12 KB |

## Project Structure

Each contract directory contains:
- **`contract/`** - Rust code (`src/lib.rs`), WIT interface (`wit/contract.wit`), and `wit/deps/` (symlink to built-in types)
- **`test/`** - Tests (`src/lib.rs`), `build.rs` (compiles, optimizes, compresses contract), and dependencies
- **Root `Cargo.toml`** - Workspace configuration

## Running Examples

To test any example contract:

```bash
cd example-contracts/token  # or any other example
cargo test
```

Tests use the Kontor runtime for simulation, loading contract bytes from `target/` after compilation. This provides fast iteration like standard Rust development. Each example assumes familiarity with prior ones, focusing on new concepts.
